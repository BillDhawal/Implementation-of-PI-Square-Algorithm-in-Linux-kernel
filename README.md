# Implementation of PI2 algorithm in Linux kernel

## Course Code: CS822

## Assignment: #FP5

### Overview
PI2 or PI Square [1] is a simplified implementation of PIE algorithm [2]. It is expected to perform similar to PIE (or sometimes better). This repository contains an implementation of PI2 in the Linux kernel.
